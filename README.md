- List all excuses for not learning a new layout and decide whether to do it or not. And then stick to the plan.
- Pick an optimal time, e.g. when getting your first split keyboard. When learning a new layout, using it on a ortholinear splitkeyboard will allow your brain to connect the old staggered rows with qwerty, allowing you to still be able to use qwerty.
- Choose the layout you like: try out workman, dvorak, coleman, etc. They all have their own feeling. Colemak focuses on rolls while dvorak focuses on switching hands as much as possible.
- Don't let single words get you down. When I first started learning colemak, the words "you" and "public" were words I hated. Go into concentrated mode and just repeat typing those single words until the fingers start typing them automatically. Now I feel look forward to these words.3
- Start out by learning on a site with very few letters in the mix and keep training until you have at least 97% accuracy before continuing. The speed does really not matter at this stage.
- Use blank keycaps to not let you look down. Don't even have a layout on your screen. Focus on memorising instead.
- Use codemonkey to track your progress, but use keybr.com to actually train. Keybr.com has very nice stats per letter and they make sentences with a mix of real and non-real words focused on making you learn the rolls on typical english phrases.
- Until you feel you do no longer need to practise, always focus on accuracy, not speed. Ironically, this will eventually improve your speed a lot more. Its like the wax-on, wax-off where karate kid learns the motions in slow motion and then is able to do them fast.
- Hand in and don't give up. Keep doing it.
- Don't compare your speed and progress to others. I have been learning colemak for 5 months and I was waaaaay slower in progressing than all the youtubers I was watching for advice.
- Some people may encourage you on your journey, but my experience is that most people will mock you for wasting your time. Don't listen to them; you are the enlightened. Beat their mockery with results.
- If you use a custom mappable keyboard, concider where you place your back space. I placed it on the left side, next to the pinky and now I wish I had placed it under a stronger finger.
- Feel free to write me, if you think I can be of any help on your journey. :)
